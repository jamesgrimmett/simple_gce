Data for stellar chemical yields, from Chiaki Kobayashi et al 2006 ApJ 653 1145.
Downloaded from the machine readable tables found here; https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/508914
Reformatted for compatibility with the Simple GCE program.

Descriptions:
  * kobayashi-2006_sn.csv is the data from Table 1 of Kobayashi 2006.
  * kobayashi-2006_hn.csv is the data from Table 2 of Kobayashi 2006.
  * kobayashi-2006_ia.csv is the data extracted from Table 3 of Kobayashi 2006.
  * kobayashi-2006_imfweighted.csv is data the extracted from Table 3 of Kobayashi 2006.

The chemical yield data taken from Tables 2 and 3 are presented as fraction of the total initial stellar mass, and the Ia data from Table 3 is given in solar masses.
This data has been rescaled and stored in each of the files with the `_scaled.csv` suffix, containing the same yield data presented as mass fractions in the ejecta (i.e., the mass fractions sum to unity)
