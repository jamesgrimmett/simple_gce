# CURRENTLY NON-FUNCTIONAL. I AM IN THE PROCESS OF UPDATING THE CODE SO THAT IT CAN BE USED MORE GENERALLY. ONCE IT'S READY TO GO I WILL REMOVE THIS MESSAGE AND ADD USAGE EXAMPLES.

A simple one-zone Galactic Chemical Evolution model, as used in [Grimmett et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05901). 

simple_gce solves the set of differential equations that represent a simplified model for an evolving galaxy.
This model allows for the infall of material from the Galactic halo (i.e. open box), and assumes homogeneous evolution (i.e. instantaneous mixing).
For a complete description of the equations and assumptions, see [Grimmett et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05901), and [Kobayashi et al. (2000)](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9908005).

I have tried to create a program that is both readable and efficient, but where I have had to choose between them, I opt for readability.
